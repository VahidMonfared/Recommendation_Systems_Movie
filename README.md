# **Movie Recommendation System Part 1**
---------------
## **Context**
---------------
Online streaming platforms like **Netflix** have plenty of movies in their repository and if we can build a **Recommendation System** to recommend **relevant movies** to users, based on their **historical interactions**, this would **improve customer satisfaction** and hence, it will also improve the revenue of the platform. The techniques that we will learn here will not only be limited to movies, it can be any item for which you want to build a recommendation system.
-----------------
## **Objective**
-----------------
In this case study, we will build various recommendation systems:
- Knowledge/Rank based recommendation system
- Similarity-Based Collaborative filtering
- Matrix Factorization Based Collaborative Filtering
To demonstrate the above techniques, we are going to use the **ratings** dataset.
-----------------
## **Dataset**
-----------------

The **ratings** dataset contains the following attributes:
- userId
- movieId
- rating
- timestamp



# **Movie Recommendation using Graph Neural Networks**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Context**
Online streaming platforms like Netflix have plenty of movies in their repositories and if we can build a recommendation system to recommend relevant movies to users based on their historical interactions, this would improve customer satisfaction and hence improve revenue. The techniques that we will learn here will not only be limited to movies, they can be implemented through a Graph Neural Networks for other problems as well.
## **Objective**
In this case study, we will be building a graph neural network (GNN) to suggest similar movies based on what movies a user has watched.
## **Dataset**
The 'ratings' dataset contains the following attributes:
- userId
- movieId
- rating
- timestamp
We will also use the 'movies' dataset to get the title of the movies. It contains the following attributes:
- movieId
- title
- genres
